# Spam-Mail-Prediction

his notebook appears to be a Machine Learning project aimed at building a spam detection system. Here's an overview:

Notebook Sections:
Importing Dependencies:

The notebook imports Python libraries like numpy, pandas, and sklearn.
Data Collection & Pre-Processing:

The data is loaded from a CSV file (mail_data.csv).
Steps for cleaning the data and handling null values are included.
Label Encoding:

Labels are assigned: "Spam" messages as 0 and "Ham" (non-spam) messages as 1.
Data Splitting:

The data is split into features (messages) and labels.
Further divided into training and testing datasets.
Feature Extraction:

Text data is transformed into feature vectors suitable for training a machine learning model.
Model Training:

A Logistic Regression algorithm is used to train the model.
Model Evaluation:

The model's accuracy is calculated for both training and testing datasets.
Building a Predictive System:

A predictive system is developed to classify input messages as spam or ham.
